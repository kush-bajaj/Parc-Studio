            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>Fast Fashion is the rapid production of inexpensive, trendy clothing that is brought quickly from the runway to the retail stores to meet the ever increasing demands of fashion today. This has proved a boon to people, who can now wear new, flashy clothes and a fraction of the cost earlier. However, 10% of global carbon dioxide output is by the fashion industry. 2700 Litres (yes that's right!) of water are required for a single cotton T Shirt. The amount of times a person wears a garment has fallen to just 7-10 times. This amounts to 100 Million Tonnes of textile waste thrown away, every year! </p>
            <p>All of the above sounds worrying, and it is! So with an aim of solving the woes of our environment caused by fast fashion, and ensuring that people still have access to trendy clothes. We have embarked on this journey will full focus, and invite you to join us. Read on for how we are solving this.</p>

            <h2>Innovation at Heart</h2>
            <p>Our pursuit of sustainability isn't just limited to intention - it's woven into the very fabric of our operations. We've harnessed the best cutting-edge technologies to redefine fashion production. From innovative materials to eco-friendly dyeing processes, we leave no stone unturned in our quest for a greener planet. We have ensured that our designing and dyeing doesn't leave any polluting elements in the environment, and recycle or repurpose any waste from production</p>
            <p>But it doesn't stop there. We take pride in our pioneering "Recycle Your Style" initiative. We know how much everyone loves to stay on top of the trend. But this also leaves a hole in their pocket, and environment. <b>Recycle Your Style</b> fixes this, showing us that recycling, repurposing and renewing of garments is not just fashion, but also a new way of life!</p>

            <h2>Recycle Your Style</h2>
            <p>87% of the materials used in the textile industry end up in either incinerators or landfills. Once the garments reach the customer, only 20% of the discarded garments are collected, and barely 1% get recycled. This is seriously concerning with over 100 Billion garments being made every year and rising, and 60% of these are actually plastic! 9% of the total microplastic pollution is contributed by the textile industry. This highlights an urgent need of initiatives to amend this.</p>

            <p>Introducing <b>Recycle Your Style</b> - a visionary movement that exemplifies our commitment to sustainability and innovation. Our customers play an active role in reshaping fashion norms. By mailing back their gently worn Parc Studios garments, they contribute to a repurposement cycle. The clothes will be recycled, renewed and repurposed. In return, they receive a discount on their next purchase, encouraging a mindful approach to consumption without sacrificing style. We will be promoting this with more and more incentives, promoting people to recycle their clothes, and conserve the environment. Our sole aim is to protect the environment, and the latest trends!</p>
